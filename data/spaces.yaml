                    This is a furniture showroom with a semi-permanent
                    installation from
                    [Devon Turnbull / OJAS](https://ojas.nyc/?utm-source=listeningspaces.net).

                    From the USM website:

                    > The design of the Ojas Listening Room at the USM NY
                    Showroom integrates Turnbull’s brutalist audio systems with
                    USM case goods, seating, and other furniture, as well as
                    Kvadrat Acoustics’ Soft Cell panels. Visitors to USM will
                    experience a calming environment in which to contemplate
                    music, liberated from the disruption of outside noise.
                    To help realize this ambitious project, Turnbull tapped
                    expert acoustician Ethan Bourdeau and creative agency
                    ICNCLST.
                    The space is now open to the public with immersive,
                    one-of-a-kind listening sessions. As part of the
                    collaboration between Ojas and USM, Turnbull will offer a
                    curated selection of products from the likes of Denon,
                    Ortofon, Western Electric, Sun Audio, MJ Magazine, Stereo
                    Sound, and others.

                    Traditionally, you find cafés playing classical or bars
                    playing jazz on a high fidelity sound system all-analog.
                    Different forms have taken shape as well.
                    We can’t say enough about these places and owners, owing
                    much to them and the music/musicians that inspire these
                    sanctuaries of sound.

                We’ve taken a melting pot of ideas from our favorite things from
                various cultures and plugged them into a bar concept.
                Unkompress is a place to enjoy eclectic music with lovely analog
                audio and natural wine, craft liquor, beer, and coffee.

                > Bar Neiro is a listening bar inspired by Japan’s jazz-kissas.
                All music is played from vinyl, and each LP is played front to
                back.
                Our sound system is custom built with premium vintage hi fi
                components.

                > We’re a wine bar with great food, local beers on tap, and
                carefully selected wines where a minimal intervention or natural
                winemaking approach has been taken.
                >
                > Equally, we’re a soundbar/audiophile listening space that adds
                an element rarely considered important in our local
                establishments.
                We’re not the first to build a bar with a hot sound system, and
                we’ve taken lots of inspiration from spaces we love in Tokyo and
                London.

                >
                > To pull all of this together we started by building our
                foundations on a warm and spacious sound experience that doesn’t
                detract from a cosy, social and conversational bar ambiance.
                >
                > In simple terms, this means a bespoke sound system and room
                acoustic treatment.
                >
                > **Unpretentious summary**: Just doing cool things in a relaxed and
                thoughtfully designed space.
